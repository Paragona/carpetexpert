        <h1>The Devil Dog's New Challenge</h1>
        <img src="loki.png" alt="Loki, the carpet artist">
        <p class="teaser">You won't believe what happened when this mischievous pup met his match!</p>
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Loki lived up to his namesake as the neighborhood's most notorious carpet artist. His specialty? Creating perfect devil horn patterns across every inch of his owner Jenny's carpets. With 35 pounds of pure mischief packed into his border collie frame, he had turned carpet-messing into an art form that no ordinary vacuum could defeat.</p>
            <p>That was until Jenny brought home the Eureka NEU350, and Loki's reign of carpet chaos met its match.</p>
            <p>On that first morning, Loki watched suspiciously as Jenny unboxed her new weapon in their ongoing battle of cleanliness versus chaos. The vacuum's sleek black and yellow design, weighing just 10.4 pounds, seemed to mock his previous victories. At $89.95, it was Jenny's latest investment in maintaining home order.</p>
            <p>Loki had just finished his masterpiece ‚Äì an intricate series of devil horns across the living room carpet ‚Äì when Jenny fired up the NEU350. The first thing he noticed was how easily she maneuvered it under his favorite hiding spot beneath the coffee table, thanks to its swivel steering. His usual safe haven was no longer so safe.</p>
            <p>The LED headlights illuminated his artwork in betraying detail, revealing even the smallest patterns he'd worked so hard to create. The 12.2-inch cleaning path meant Jenny could erase his designs faster than ever before. The 25-foot cord length let her reach every corner of his gallery without switching outlets.</p>
            <p>Loki watched in dismay as the dual cyclone technology made quick work of his carefully crafted mess. The 13 kpa suction power lifted every bit of fur and debris he'd so artistically arranged. Through the transparent brushroll window, he could actually see his masterpiece disappearing into the 1.5L dust cup.</p>
            <p>When Jenny switched from carpet to hardwood floors with a simple adjustment, Loki realized his domain had truly been conquered. Even his backup plan of spreading fur everywhere was thwarted by the included pet turbo brush and crevice tool.</p>
            <p>That evening, as Jenny finished cleaning with a triumphant smile, Loki lay on his bed, contemplating his next move. Perhaps it was time to take his artistic talents to the backyard garden instead. After all, mud patterns were much harder to vacuum.</p>
            <p>As he dozed off, he couldn't help but respect this worthy opponent. The Eureka NEU350 had won this battle, but tomorrow was another day, and this devil dog still had a few tricks up his sleeve.</p>
