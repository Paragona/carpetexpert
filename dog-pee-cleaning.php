    <h1>The Ultimate Guide: How to Clean Dog Pee from Carpet Effectively</h1>
    <p>Accidents happen, and even the best-trained dogs can leave you dealing with a carpet stain now and then. Dog urine can be challenging to clean, but with the right techniques and tools, you can eliminate both the stain and odor quickly and effectively. Here's your comprehensive guide to getting the job done.</p>

    <main>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Why You Should Act Fast</h2>
            <p>Urine quickly seeps into carpet fibers and the padding underneath. Acting quickly can prevent the stain from setting and eliminate long-term odors.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Step 1: Blot the Area Immediately</h2>
            <p>Use a clean, absorbent cloth or paper towels to blot up as much urine as possible. Avoid scrubbing or rubbingâ€”it can spread the stain deeper into the carpet fibers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Step 2: Choose the Right Cleaning Method</h2>
            <p>Here are a few proven cleaning techniques. Choose the one that best suits your needs and available supplies.</p>

            <div class="method">

                    <li>Spray generously over the affected area.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle baking soda on top and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Blot with a clean cloth to absorb the moisture.</li>
                    <li>Once dry, vacuum thoroughly to remove the baking soda.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="method">

            <h2>Step 3: Deodorize the Carpet</h2>
