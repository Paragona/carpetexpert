    <p>Learn the most effective ways to clean pet urine from carpets, remove odors, and keep your home fresh. Step-by-step methods and tips included!</p>

    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dealing with pet urine on your carpet can be a frustrating experience. The smell, the stain, and the potential damage can be overwhelming. Thankfully, with the right techniques and tools, you can easily clean pet urine from carpets and restore freshness to your home.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Act Quickly</h3>
                <p>As soon as you notice the accident, blot up as much urine as possible using a clean cloth or paper towels. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain further into the fibers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Use a Vinegar Solution</h3>
                <p>Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution generously over the affected area to neutralize the odor and loosen the stain. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before blotting it dry.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Apply Baking Soda</h3>
                <p>Sprinkle a generous layer of baking soda over the damp area. Baking soda will absorb any remaining moisture and help neutralize odors. Leave it overnight for the best results.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Vacuum Thoroughly</h3>
                <p>Vacuum up the baking soda the next day to reveal a clean, odor-free carpet. For a more thorough clean, consider using a specialized vacuum cleaner designed for pet stains, such as the <a href="https://amzn.to/40OtIxH" target="_blank">Eureka MaxSwivel Pro NEU350 Upright Vacuum Cleaner</a>.</p>

                <h3>Step 5: Use an Enzymatic Cleaner</h3>
                <p>For stubborn stains or strong odors, use an enzymatic cleaner. These cleaners are formulated to break down the proteins in urine, effectively removing the smell at its source. Follow the product's instructions for the best results.</p>

            <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid using ammonia-based cleaners, as the smell may attract pets to urinate in the same spot again.</li>
                <li>For recurring issues, consider using a pet repellent spray to discourage accidents in specific areas.</li>
                <li>Ensure your pet is well-hydrated to prevent concentrated urine, which is more odorous and difficult to clean.</li>
            </ul>
