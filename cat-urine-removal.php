    <h1>How to Clean Cat Urine Off Carpet: A Complete Guide</h1>
    <p>Discover effective methods to remove cat urine from carpets, eliminate odors, and keep your home fresh. Step-by-step solutions and pro tips included!</p>

    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cat urine is notorious for its strong odor and the difficulty of cleaning it from carpets. Acting quickly and using the right techniques can help you remove the stain and odor completely. Here's a practical guide to clean cat urine off your carpet effectively.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Blot the Urine Immediately</h3>
                <p>Use clean paper towels or a cloth to blot as much urine as possible from the carpet. Press firmly to absorb the moisture, but avoid scrubbing to prevent spreading the stain deeper into the fibers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Neutralize with a Vinegar Solution</h3>
                <p>Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution generously on the affected area to neutralize the smell. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then blot the area with a clean cloth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Apply Baking Soda</h3>
                <p>Once the area is damp from the vinegar solution, sprinkle baking soda over it. Baking soda helps to absorb odors and moisture. Allow it to sit for several hours or overnight.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Vacuum the Area</h3>
                <p>After the baking soda has dried, vacuum it thoroughly to remove the residue. A powerful vacuum cleaner, such as the <a href="https://amzn.to/40OtIxH" target="_blank">Eureka MaxSwivel Pro NEU350 Upright Vacuum Cleaner</a>, works exceptionally well for this step, especially if you have pets.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Use an Enzymatic Cleaner</h3>
                <p>For persistent odors, apply an enzymatic cleaner specifically designed for pet urine. These cleaners break down the proteins in cat urine that cause the odor. Follow the product's instructions and allow it to soak into the carpet for maximum effectiveness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 6: Prevent Future Accidents</h3>
                <p>Cats often return to the same spot if they smell remnants of urine. To deter this behavior, use a pet-safe odor neutralizer or repellent after cleaning.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="tips">
            <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid using ammonia-based cleaners, as their smell mimics urine and may encourage your cat to re-mark the area.</li>
                <li>Consider placing a litter box closer to areas where accidents frequently occur.</li>
                <li>Ensure your cat's litter box is clean and easily accessible to prevent accidents in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
