        {
          "title": "Step 1: Blot the Urine Immediately",
          "content": "Use clean paper towels or a cloth to blot as much urine as possible from the carpet. Press firmly to absorb the moisture, but avoid scrubbing to prevent spreading the stain deeper into the fibers."

          "content": "Mix equal parts of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray the solution generously on the affected area to neutralize the smell. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then blot the area with a clean cloth."
